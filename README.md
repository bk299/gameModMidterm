### Bloons Tower Defense in Quake 4
###### *Press 'h' while playing the mod to show a help screen that shows some of the information below.*
This mod is meant to be a remake of Bloons TD in Quake 4.\
What resulted from this project is an interpretation of a tower defense game.\
The weapons are turned into "monkey" spawners, and you can shoot each weapon to spawn a different monkey.\
There are currently 5 waves to showcase the 5 different "bloons" in the game.\
I also included a few player upgrades in this mod:\
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1\.&nbsp; Pressing 'i': Increases player speed (costs 100 money)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2\.&nbsp; Pressing 'o': Buy a life (costs 50 money)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\.&nbsp; Pressing 'p': Sell a life (gives 30 money)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\.&nbsp; Pressing '[': Buy 10 health (costs 50 money)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\.&nbsp; Pressing ']': Buy 10 armor (costs 50 money)\
\
Once you lose all of your lives or defeat all of the waves, the game is over!
